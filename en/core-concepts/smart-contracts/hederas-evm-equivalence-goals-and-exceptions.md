# Hedera's EVM Equivalence Goals and Exceptions

Hedera aims to achieve [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) equivalence to enhance the programmability and adoption of the network. This page outlines Hedera's EVM equivalence goals and highlights the key differences and exceptions between Hedera and [Ethereum](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#ethereum).

## Hedera's EVM Equivalence Goals

Hedera's EVM equivalence strategy is designed to empower developers by facilitating the execution of EVM smart contracts more rapidly and cost-effectively while ensuring seamless integration of Hederaâ€™s native services. The key goals include:

#### Robust Application Programmability

Hedera aims to enable a wider range of application programmability without sacrificing its unique value. This means allowing developers to build a diverse range of applications on the Hedera network, from [decentralized finance (DeFi)](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#decentralized-finance-defi) applications to supply chain solutions, while still benefiting from the unique features of Hedera, such as its speed, security, and fairness.

#### Seamless Integration

Hedera plans to integrate its native services with the EVM seamlessly. This will allow developers to execute [smart contracts](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#smart-contract) more rapidly and cost-effectively. It will also make it easier for developers to use Hedera's services, as they can use the same tools and languages they are already familiar with from the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### Leverage Existing Expertise

Hedera's strategy involves leveraging the [HyperLedger Besu EVM](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#hyperledger-besu-evm) client, which allows developers to capitalize on their existing Solidity expertise. This means that developers already familiar with [Solidity](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#solidity) and the EVM can easily transition to developing on Hedera, taking advantage of its unique strengths such as faster transactions, low and fixed fees, fair transaction ordering, immediate finality, and heightened security.

#### Smooth Transition

Hedera aims to provide a seamless transition for developers already working with EVM-based platforms. This means making it easy for developers to move their existing applications, smart contracts, and other digital assets to the Hedera network. This goal aims to encourage the adoption of the Hedera network by reducing the barriers to entry for developers.

#### Support for EVM Tools

Hedera plans to support familiar [EVM tools](../../#evm-compatible-tools), libraries, and environments. This includes providing support for popular development environments like [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/) and [HardHat](https://hardhat.org/), as well as libraries like [Web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) and [EthersJS](https://ethers.org/). The network also supports tools like [MetaMask](../../support-and-community/glossary.md#metamask), [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), and [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en\&optimize=false\&runs=200\&evmVersion=null). This goal is to make it easier for developers to build on Hedera, as they can use the same tools they are already familiar with from the Ethereum ecosystem.

#### Community Engagement

Hedera encourages developers to contribute to its EVM development and join the community discussions in the official [Hedera Discord](https://www.hedera.com/discord). This goal aims to foster a vibrant and engaged developer community, which is crucial for the long-term success and sustainability of the Hedera network.

## Key Differences and Exceptions between Hedera and Ethereum

While Hedera strives for EVM equivalence, it's important to recognize certain unique aspects and fundamental differences in its network architecture and operations, such as the handling of state data structures, hashing algorithms, and the management of accounts and transactions. These distinctions in network behaviors are intentional design choices made to align with EVM standards, thereby achieving EVM compatibility. This approach ensures that while Hedera aligns closely with Ethereum, it also maintains its distinctive features and optimization.

### Network Differences

| Function                         | Hedera              | Ethereum             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Network State Data Structure** | Virtual Merkle Tree | Merkle Patricia Trie |
| **Hashing Algorithm**            | SHA-384             | Keccak-256           |
