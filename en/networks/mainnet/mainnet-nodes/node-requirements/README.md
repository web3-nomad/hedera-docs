# Node Requirements

The following is provided to help [_Hedera Governing Council_](https://hedera.com/council) members deploy their permissioned mainnet consensus node. Please note, this information is not intended to apply to Hedera's transition to a permissionless network.

## Minimum Node Platform Requirements

Currently, the Hedera Mainnet will perform at a rate determined by the lowest-performing node. To ensure a common level of performance minimum hardware, connectivity, and hosting requirements have been defined for the initial permissioned, Governing Council nodes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To ensure accurate conformity with the minimum requirements, please provide node hardware, connectivity, and hosting details to Hedera prior to purchase (devops@swirldslabs.com).

   2. Establish regular deployment team meeting cadence
2. Conveyance of technical requirements and discussion of deployment options
3. Node platform acquisition
   1. Hardware or virtual instance
   2. Network connectivity
   3. Hosting facility
4. Configuration of the operating system on platform
   1. Provisioning of accounts as specified
   2. Provisioning of network access (firewall rules/access control lists)
5. Conveyance of credentials to Hedera
   1. Includes any special instructions for permissioned access such as VPNs
   2. Discussion of support and escalation paths between organizations
6. Hedera undertakes configuration review
   1. Platform
   2. Connectivity
7. Deployment of Hedera consensus node software and required supporting libraries
8. Add connection configuration for a Hedera performance testnet
   1. Hedera executes functional, stability and performance tests for all network services
9. Review of test results and determination of preparedness for mainnet connectivity
   1. Review key management documentation related to Council Member's accounts including: fee account, proxy staking account, et al.
   2. Update private keys using provided tools
10. Schedule mainnet connection
11. Mainnet live
