# DAO Proposals

To create a proposal on chain, you must have sufficient voting power. This information can be found on the DAO's **Overview** tab from the [HashioDAO](https://hashiodao.swirldslabs.com/) dashboard.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: There are no snapshots, like Ethereum-based DAOs, instead, your tokens are locked up for the duration of the vote. Your voting power is equal to the amount of tokens you lock up.
{% endhint %}

Click on **Manage** and lock up tokens to increase your voting powers.
