# Configuring Hashio RPC endpoints

[Hashio](https://swirldslabs.com/hashio/) is a public RPC endpoint hosted by Swirlds Labs. As a _public_ endpoint, it:

* Is free to use
* Does not have any sign-up requirements
* Has significantly restrictive rate limits

While this combination may be considered less reliable, it offers the highest levels of ease of use among RPC endpoints.

To connect to the Hedera networks via Hashio, simply use this URL when initializing the wallet or web3 provider instance:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Hedera Mainnet" %}
```
https://mainnet.hashio.io/api
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Hedera Testnet" %}
```
https://testnet.hashio.io/api
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Hedera Previewnet" %}
```
https://previewnet.hashio.io/api
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

No further settings or configurations are needed!
