# Introduction

Through this short _Getting Started_ coding series, you will learn the basics of creating an account, transferring **HBAR**, signing, and submitting transactions to the _Hedera Testnet_. The Hedera test network allows you to play with our APIs in a non-production environment. You will see how easy it is to get started with one of our [Hedera SDKs](../sdks-and-apis/) in the programming language of your choice. First, you must create a Hedera Portal profile to receive test **HBAR**.

### Create Hedera Portal Profile (Faucet)

The _Hedera Testnet_ account allows you to interact with our [APIs](../sdks-and-apis/) and pay for the transaction fees. Visit the [Hedera portal](https://portal.hedera.com/register) to create your _Hedera Testnet_ account and follow the instructions.

Once you have completed the instructions, you will receive a _Hedera Testnet_ account ID (0.0.x) and your private/public key pair on your testnet page. You will need to copy over your **account ID** and the **DER-encoded private key** information when you set up your coding environment in the following steps.

_**Note:** Your Hedera Testnet account will be credited with 10,000 test_ **HBAR** _upon creation that can only be utilized on the Hedera test network. Your balance will be topped up daily to 10,000 test_ **HBAR** _when you use your funds._
