  Hello World sequence: Create a new account on Hedera Testnet, and fund it. Do
  this before any of the other Hello World sequences.

# Create and fund account

## What you will accomplish

* ✅ Create an account on Hedera Testnet
* ✅ Fund this new account with tHBAR

The repo, [`github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/), is intended to be used alongside this tutorial.

***

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should be familiar with the following:

* ✅ Javascript syntax

Also, you should have the following set up on your computer:

* ✅ `git` installed
  * Minimum version: 2.37
  * [Install Git (Github)](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* ✅ NodeJs + `npm` installed
  * Minimum version of NodeJs: 18
  * Minimum version of `npm`: 9.5
  * Recommended for Linux & Mac: [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  * Recommended for Windows: [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
* ✅ POSIX-compliant shell
  * For Linux & Mac: The shell that ships with the operating system will work. Either `bash` or `zsh` will work.
  * For Windows: The shell that ships with the operating system (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) will _not_ work. Recommended alternatives: WSL/2, or git-bash which ships with git-for-windows.

## Steps

### Set up project

To follow along, start with the `main` branch, which is the _default branch_ of this repo. This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along with the steps as described in the tutorial.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hedera-dev/hello-future-world.git
```

In the terminal, make a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.sample` file. Then open that file in a code editor, such as VS code (`code`).

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
cp .env.sample .env
code .env
```

### Create account

If you already have an account on the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com), you may skip the following steps.

<details>

<summary>Set up a Hedera Portal account</summary>

Visit the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com), and create a Testnet account.

[![localhost-init-step-03](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tgkvS.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tgkvS.png)

Copy-paste the confirmation code sent to your email.

[![localhost-init-step-04](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4H9XT.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4H9XT.png)

Fill out this form.

[![localhost-init-step-05](https://i.stack.imgur.com/atW69.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/atW69.png)

In the top-left select Hedera Testnet from the drop-down.

[![localhost-init-step-07](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2A2ua.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2A2ua.png)

</details>

The main screen of the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com), should show you your accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that there are 2 separate accounts on this page.

* (1) Account Ed25519
* (2) Account ECDSA

To follow along, use **Account ECDSA**.
{% endhint %}

Copy the value of "HEX Encoded Private Key", and replace `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` in the `.env` file with it.

[![localhost-init-step-08](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrQbt.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/PrQbt.png)

From the same screen, copy the value of "Account ID", and replace `ACCOUNT_ID` in the `.env` file with it.

For example, if your Account ID is `0.0.123`, and your DER encoded private key is `0xabcd1234`, the 2 lines in your `.env` file should look like this:

```
ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.123
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabcd1234
```

🎉 Now you are ready to start using your Hedera Testnet account from the portal within script files on your computer! 🎉

***

### Write the script

An almost-complete script has already been prepared for you, and you will only need to make a few modifications (outlined below) for it to run successfully.

First, install the dependencies using `npm`.

```shell
npm install
```

Then open the script file, `script-create-fund-account.js`, in a code editor.

#### Step 1: Initialise account using `Client`

Initialise the `client` instance by invoking the `setOperator` method, and passing in `accountId` and `accountKey` as parameter.

```javascript
    const client = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(accountId, accountKey);
```

Now the `client` instance represents and operates your account.

#### Step 2: Obtain the balance of the account

Use the `AccountBalanceQuery` method to obtain the tHBAR balance of your account.

```javascript
    const accountBalance = await new AccountBalanceQuery()
```

Note that the return value is an object, and needs to be parsed.

#### Step 3: Convert balance result object to Hbars

Parse that return value to extract its tHBAR balance, so that you may convert into a string for display purposes.

```javascript
    const accountBalanceHbars = accountBalance.hbars.toBigNumber();
```

### Run the script

Run the script using the following command:

```shell
node script-create-fund-account.js
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
accountId: 0.0.1186
accountBalanceTinybars: 10,000.00000000
accountExplorerUrl: https://hashscan.io/testnet/account/0.0.1186
```

Open the URL, that was output as `accountExplorerUrl` above, in your browser and check that:

* (1) The accounts exists.
* (2) The balance matches.

***

## Complete

Congratulations, you have completed this Hello World sequence! 🎉🎉🎉

***

### Next Steps

Now that you have an account on Hedera Testnet, and it is funded, you will be able to interact with the Hedera network. Continue by following along with [the other Hello World sequences](./).

## Cheat sheet

<details>

<summary>Skip to final state</summary>

To skip ahead to the final state, use the `completed` branch. This gives you the final state with which you can compare your implementation to the completed steps of the tutorial.

```shell
git fetch origin completed:completed
git checkout completed
```

To see the full set of differences between the initial and final states of the repo, you can use `diff`.

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
git diff main..completed -- ./
```

Alternatively, you may view the `diff` rendered on Github: [`hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed) (This will show the `diff` for _all_ sequences.)

Note that the branch names are delimited by `..`, and not by `...`, as the latter finds the `diff` with the latest common ancestor commit, which _is not_ what we want in this case.
