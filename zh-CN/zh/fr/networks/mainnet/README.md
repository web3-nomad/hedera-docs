# Mainnet

## Overview

The Hedera mainnet (short for main network) is where applications are run in production, with transaction fees paid in [HBAR](https://www.hedera.com/hbar). Transactions are submitted to the Hedera mainnet by any application or retail user; they're automatically consensus timestamped and fairly ordered.\&#x20

Data associated with Hedera's services and stored on-chain can be queried by any Hedera account. Every transaction requires payment in the form of a **transaction fee** denominated in _**tinybars**_ (100,000,000 tℏ = 1 ℏ). You can learn more about transaction fees and estimate your application costs [here](https://www.hedera.com/fees).\&#x20

If you're looking to test your application (or just experiment), please visit [Testnet Access](../testnet/testnet-access.md). The Hedera testnet enables developers to prototype and test applications in a simulated mainnet environment that uses test _HBAR_ for paying transaction fees.

**Transaction Throttles**\
Transactions on the Hedera Mainnet are currently throttled. You will receive a `"BUSY"` response if the number of transactions submitted to the network exceeds the threshold value.
