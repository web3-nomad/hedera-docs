# Wipe a token

Wipes the provided amount of fungible or non-fungible tokens from the specified Hedera account. This transaction does not delete tokens from the treasury account. This transaction must be signed by the token's Wipe Key. Wiping an account's tokens burns the tokens and decreases the total supply.

* If the provided account is not found, the transaction will resolve to `INVALID_ACCOUNT_ID`.
* If the provided account has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to `ACCOUNT_DELETED`
* If the provided token is not found, the transaction will resolve to `INVALID_TOKEN_ID`.
* If the provided token has been deleted, the transaction will resolve to `TOKEN_WAS_DELETED`.
* If an Association between the provided token and account is not found, the transaction will resolve to `TOKEN_NOT_ASSOCIATED_TO_ACCOUNT`.
* If Wipe Key is not present in the Token, the transaction results in `TOKEN_HAS_NO_WIPE_KEY`.
* If the provided account is the token's Treasury Account, the transaction results in `CANNOT_WIPE_TOKEN_TREASURY_ACCOUNT`
* On success, tokens are removed from the account and the total supply of the token is decreased by the wiped amount.
* The amount provided is in the lowest denomination possible.
  * Example: Token A has 2 decimals. In order to wipe 100 tokens from an account, one must provide an amount of 10000. In order to wipe 100.55 tokens, one must provide an amount of 10055.
* This transaction accepts zero unit token wipe operations for fungible tokens ([HIP-564](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-564))

**Transaction Signing Requirements:**

* Wipe key
* Transaction fee payer account key
